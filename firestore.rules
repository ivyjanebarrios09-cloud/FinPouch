     * @description This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for device registration and wallet activity.
     * All data is nested under /users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}, ensuring data isolation.
     * Key Security Decisions:
     *   - Users can only manage their own devices and view their own wallet activity.
     *   - Listing of devices and wallet activity is allowed only for the owning user.
     *   - Device and wallet activity data shape is not strictly validated to allow for rapid iteration.
     * Denormalization for Authorization:
     *   - The userId field within the device and walletActivity documents is used to validate ownership against the path.
     * Structural Segregation:
     *   - All device and wallet activity data is private and stored under user-specific paths.
